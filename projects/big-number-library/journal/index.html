			<h4>Arbitrary-precision integer class (big_integer)</h4>
			<p>
				In planning this project, I thought creating such a class (in an efficient manner) would be a relatively easy task, taking no more than a week to complete.
				This prediction was very wrong.
				Creating an arbitrary-precision integer that uses efficient storage and supports all basic operations was a lot more difficult than I would have imagined.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Storage</b> -
				The most efficient way I could think to store an arbitrary-precision number is a vector of 32-bit unsigned integers, a resizable array of 32-bit words.
				This would also allow me to take advantage of the innate 64-bit registers and arithmetic operations in interemdiate calculations (such as in addition and multiplication).
				The primary reason for choosing this storage method is for efficiency (especially when dealing with fixed-precision numbers).
				The alternative would be storing each digit individually (or pairs of integers), but the inefficiency in this approach would grow with the size of the number.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Addition and Multiplication</b> -
				Addition was fairly straight forward as it's just a single loop through the elements in each vector, with slight resizing if necessary.
				Multiplication was significantly more difficult, however. I chose the simple approach to use the O(n<sup>2</sup>) double loop algorithm for multiplication,
				but there were additional difficulties in managing upper and lower bits from the results of multiplying two words and ensuring this result is added in the correct
				location of the resulting integer.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Parsing from a string</b> -
				The easiest way for a user to define a large number is through a string, as there is no limit to how long this can be.
				However, there is some complexity in turning a series of base-10 digits into a series of 32-bit words.
				My method for doing so involves splitting the string into chunks of 9-digit segments, turning that into a single 32-bit word, multiplying it by 10<sup>9i</sup>,
				then adding it to the resulting big_integer.
				As long as my multiplication algorithm relies on the slow O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm, this process will be inefficient; however, this is the most succinct method
				I could find to complete this process.
			</p>

			<h4>Schedule Changes</h4>
			<p>
				I am planning on dedicating the next week, and possibly the following week, on further developing the big_integer class, as I was only able to accomplish
				storing numbers, addition, multiplication, and parsing from a string.
				The primary reason for this is that it was a lot more work than I previously expected.
				In addition, I believe that having an extensive development of this class will allow the fixed-precision integer class to be significantly easier,
				as the primary difference is the resizing and scalability; the rest of the algorithmic complexity should be nearly identical.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the big_integer class is complete, I plan on working on the fixed-precision integer class for a week, as well as further fleshing out the integral math functions section.
				Development of floating-point numbers will continue afterwards.

			<h4>Project Setup</h4>
			<p>
				Before I could even set up the project, I had to decide whether I was going to use a statically-linked library (.lib) or a dynaimcally-linked library (.dll).
				In the end, I decided on using a statically-linked library as I figure it would be safer to use.
				Setting up the project afterwards was not terribly difficult; create a solution in Visual Studio, add a statically-linked library project for the library,
				then add a unit tets project for unit tests.
			</p>
			<p>
				One C++ feature I wanted to look into for this project that I wasn't able to play with on any previous project is modules.
				They were not too difficult to understand at the basic level, but I did have some trouble with module partitions, and I am still not satisfied with my current partitions.
				My biggest issue right now is I want to have a "math" partition which will host all sorts of math functions (similar to std::sin),
				but I am not able to import the partition for my integer type.
				While I don't need to access these types in the math partition, as I can just use concepts, I'm not entirely sure in what partition I want to store the concept,
				as both the number class partitions and the math partition will need to access it.
				I have played around with different partitions, and haven't settled on one I feel fits properly, so I will continue to improve this in later weeks.
			</p>

			<h4>Basic Integer and Float</h4>
			<p>
				Neither of these were terribly difficult, the biggest task was ensuring I had all of the operator overloads that numeric types would use, excluding logical operators.
				Upon doing research, I found that for binary operators that return a copy as a result (such as addition and subtraction), it is slightly more efficient when chained together
				(such as a + b + c) for these to be friend functions that take a non-reference left-hand argument.
				Lastly, I also wanted to ensure these classes support insertion and extraction through streams, which are additional friend functions within the class.
			</p>

			<h4>Unit Tests</h4>
			<p>
				Although I could have created in-depth unit tests for each of the operators and math functions, I figured it would be better to hold off for now, as I would need to
				change them later to support significantly larger numbers and ensure that works. For now, I just have some basic unit tests to ensure that the unit tests project is
				set up properly and can access module classes and functions.

			<h3>Project Description</h3>
			<p>
				This project aims to create a C++ Library for an efficient implementation of big numbers (larger than 64-bit).
				There are three categories of number classes that I want to create for this project: arbitrary-precision, fixed-precision, and fast-big (class names TBD).
				For the first two categories, both integer and floating-point classes will exist, while there will only exist floating-point numbers for fast-big.
				As a stretch goal, I would also like to create a complex number class (that hinges on any of these previous classes for numerical storage) to further flesh out this library.
			</p>
			<p>
				Below is the preliminary weekly schedule for this project.
				I intend for many tasks to shift around depending on how long other tasks take to complete, the complexity of some tasks after more research is done, and unexpected developments.
				During each of my weekly updates, I intend to have a refined weekly task list as well as updates on what was and was not completed the previous week.
