			<h4>Project Setup</h4>
			<p>
				Before I could even set up the project, I had to decide whether I was going to use a statically-linked library (.lib) or a dynaimcally-linked library (.dll).
				In the end, I decided on using a statically-linked library as I figure it would be safer to use.
				Setting up the project afterwards was not terribly difficult; create a solution in Visual Studio, add a statically-linked library project for the library,
				then add a unit tets project for unit tests.
			</p>
			<p>
				One C++ feature I wanted to look into for this project that I wasn't able to play with on any previous project is modules.
				They were not too difficult to understand at the basic level, but I did have some trouble with module partitions, and I am still not satisfied with my current partitions.
				My biggest issue right now is I want to have a "math" partition which will host all sorts of math functions (similar to std::sin),
				but I am not able to import the partition for my integer type.
				While I don't need to access these types in the math partition, as I can just use concepts, I'm not entirely sure in what partition I want to store the concept,
				as both the number class partitions and the math partition will need to access it.
				I have played around with different partitions, and haven't settled on one I feel fits properly, so I will continue to improve this in later weeks.
			</p>

			<h4>Basic Integer and Float</h4>
			<p>
				Neither of these were terribly difficult, the biggest task was ensuring I had all of the operator overloads that numeric types would use, excluding logical operators.
				Upon doing research, I found that for binary operators that return a copy as a result (such as addition and subtraction), it is slightly more efficient when chained together
				(such as a + b + c) for these to be friend functions that take a non-reference left-hand argument.
				Lastly, I also wanted to ensure these classes support insertion and extraction through streams, which are additional friend functions within the class.
			</p>

			<h4>Unit Tests</h4>
			<p>
				Although I could have created in-depth unit tests for each of the operators and math functions, I figured it would be better to hold off for now, as I would need to
				change them later to support significantly larger numbers and ensure that works. For now, I just have some basic unit tests to ensure that the unit tests project is
				set up properly and can access module classes and functions.

			<h3>Project Description</h3>
			<p>
				This project aims to create a C++ Library for an efficient implementation of big numbers (larger than 64-bit).
				There are three categories of number classes that I want to create for this project: arbitrary-precision, fixed-precision, and fast-big (class names TBD).
				For the first two categories, both integer and floating-point classes will exist, while there will only exist floating-point numbers for fast-big.
				As a stretch goal, I would also like to create a complex number class (that hinges on any of these previous classes for numerical storage) to further flesh out this library.
			</p>
			<p>
				Below is the preliminary weekly schedule for this project.
				I intend for many tasks to shift around depending on how long other tasks take to complete, the complexity of some tasks after more research is done, and unexpected developments.
				During each of my weekly updates, I intend to have a refined weekly task list as well as updates on what was and was not completed the previous week.
