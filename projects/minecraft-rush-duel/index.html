		<hr>

		<!-- Overview -->
		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>
			This project aims to create a functional 1.19.4 Minecraft mod that adds Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duels to the game.
			This mod will primarily focus on multiplayer content, as this will allow players to duel against one another.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope that this mod will be Survival friendly, meaning players can obtain most items without the need for cheats or commands.
			Some developer items or incomplete items may be locked behind Creative mode or commands, however.
