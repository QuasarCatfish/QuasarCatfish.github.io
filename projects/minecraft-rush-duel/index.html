		<h1>Minecraft Rush Duel Mod</h1>
		<hr>

		<!-- Overview -->
		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>
			This project aims to create a functional 1.19.4 Minecraft mod that adds Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duels to the game.
			This mod will primarily focus on multiplayer content, as this will allow players to duel against one another.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope that this mod will be Survival friendly, meaning players can obtain most items without the need for cheats or commands.
			Some developer items or incomplete items may be locked behind Creative mode or commands, however.
		</p>

		<h3>Week 0</h3>
		<h4>May 15 to May 21</h4>
		<p>
			This week has been focused on creating the proposal for this project and setting up this page.
			<a href="/projects/minecraft-rush-duel#tasks">A list of the project's tasks can be found here</a>.
			While the tasks are divided into "Minimum Viable Product" and "Stretch Goals", I intend to implement several stretch goal features within the project.
			This only serves as a defensive measure in case the required tasks take longer than expected to implement.
		</p>
		<p>
			Below is the preliminary weekly schedule for this project.
			I intend for many tasks to shift around depending on how long other tasks take to complete, the complexity of some tasks after more research is done, and unexpected developments.
			During each of my weekly updates, I intend to have a refined weekly task list as well as updates on what was and was not completed the previous week.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <a href="/projects/minecraft-rush-duel#journal">Developer Journal</a> section on the main page will serve to host the most recent weekly update on the project while
			<a href="/projects/minecraft-rush-duel/journal">this page</a> will serve to host daily updates as well as all previous weekly updates.
