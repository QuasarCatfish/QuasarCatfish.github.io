				<td>Chess-like Gacha Game</td>
				<td class="align-left">
					There have been many games that add unique Chess pieces to the game. Most recently, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2096510/The_Ouroboros_King/">The Ouroboros King</a> merged the genres of Chess and Roguelike, adding custom pieces and unique boards to chess.
					With this project, I am to merge Chess with Gacha.

					<fieldset>
						<legend>Units</legend>
						Traditional Gacha games feature a battle system where you can include any unit as long as the total cost of all units does not exceed a specified limit.
						For this, I envision each chess piece being of a certain cost (for example Pawns are 1, Knights are 3, Rooks are 5, etc).
						Additionally, since Kings will have a worth, you will be allowed to have multiple Kings. You are also required to have at least one King (or King-like piece).
						One difference from normal chess is the lack of checks and checkmate. Instead, you must capture all of your opponent's Kings (or King-like pieces) to win the game.
						<br />
						<br />
						
						You can arange your pieces in any which way on the board, in the 4 ranks closest to you (as to not start behind enemy lines).
						You are required to have at least one piece (a King or King-like piece).
						The sum of your units' costs cannot exceed the total unit cost you are allowed.
						<br />
						<br />
						
						Another cost mechanic can be the type of board you use. While the traditional 8x4 board may give you a limit of 40 unit cost, a more difficult board may give you a higher unit cost limit.
						This can add much more depth to the strategies players need to consider when constructing their army.
						<br />
						<br />

						There are two ways that "Going First" can be handled.
						<ol>
							<li>A coin is flipped and the winning player gets to choose whether they want to play White or Black.</li>
							<li>The turn player is randomly selected, but the player has two different board setups, a "Going First" and "Going Second" board.</li>
						</ol>
						The first option is much more typical in card games, but playtesting will need to be done to see which system is better.
					</fieldset>

					<fieldset>
						<legend>Gacha</legend>
						For each game you play, you earn gacha currency (significantly more for winning than losing), which can be spent at the gacha.
						There will be different sets of pieces to choose from, such as the "Standard Set" containing Pawns, Rooks, Bishops, Knights, Queens, and Kings.
						By purchasing a roll from this set, the player will receive one piece at random (weighted) as well as crafting material to create additional pieces.
						These pieces can then be added to the player's team.
					</fieldset>

					<fieldset>
						<legend>Ranking</legend>
						As with traditional chess, an ELO (or ELO-like) system will be used to rank players.
						When queueing in ranked matches, a player of a similar ranking will be chosen, to have as fair a game as possible.
					</fieldset>

					<fieldset>
						<legend>Alternative Formats</legend>
						<b>Draft</b>
						<br />
						Each player is presented with a "pack" of three pieces, they choose one to add to their "deck", then their opponent chooses one of the remaining two pieces (the final piece is discarded).
						This process is repeated until each player has 16 pieces in their "deck".
						Afterwards, each player sets up their board (normal restrictions apply) and the game ensues afterwards.
						This would have a separate ranking system from "constructed".
						<br />
						<br />

						<b>Random</b>
						<br />
						Players make no choice in what their pieces are or how their board is setup, only that their and their opponent's boards are roughly equal in power.
						This would have a separate ranking system from "constructed".

				<td>Minecraft Mod</td>
				<td class="align-left">
					As Minecraft is the best-selling game of all time, as well as Mojang being a company I am interested in working at, it could be helpful to create a mod for Minecraft (either 1.19.4 or 1.20.X if it releases before the summertime).
					While I haven't completely decided on the theme or contents of the mod, below are some ideas of other popular media I enjoy that would be interesting to bring into Minecraft.
					<br />
					
					<fieldset>
						<legend>Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel</legend>
						Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel is a card game based on the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game and Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game.
						It has simpler rules than its predecessors and aims for much shorter match times.
						Outside of unofficial simulators, it is currently exclusive to Japan and Korea.
						
						<ul>
							<li>The ability to open packs and store cards within a specialized container</li>
							<li>The ability to duel against another player (possibly automatic?)</li>
							<li>The ability to easily update the card pool or add custom cards to the world</li>
						</ul>
					</fieldset>
					<br />

					<fieldset>
						<legend>Fossil Fighters</legend>
						Fossil Fighters and Fossil Fighters: Champions are games released for the Nintendo DS that lets the player dig for fossils, revive them into Vivosaurs, and use those Vivosaurs for battle.
						These games have a unique 3v3 battle system where all dinosaurs have a collective stamina called "Fossil Power" (or FP for short).
						All Vivosaurs are grouped into one of five elements, with each element being strong or weak against another.

						<ul>
							<li>The ability to dig for fossils and revive them into Vivosaur medals</li>
							<li>The fossil cleaning minigame</li>
							<li>The ability to battle against other players using faithful battle mechanics (to either Fossil Fighters or Fossil Fighters: Champions)</li>
						</ul>
					</fieldset>
					<br />

					<fieldset>
						<legend>RPG Adventure</legend>
						<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aether">The Aether</a> and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-twilight-forest">The Twilight Forest</a> are two very inspirational Minecraft mods, providing a unique adventure for the player to embark on.
						Both mods feature a series of dungeons and bosses for the player to find and conquer, entailing a fun adventure for any player.
						Each dungeon and boss has unique mechanics, requiring the player to be crafty and creative with how they solve the puzzles and defeat the boss at the end of the dungeon.

						<ul>
							<li>Unique minerals and toolsets</li>
							<li>Some form of progression</li>
							<li>Bosses and Puzzles</li>
						</ul>
					</fieldset>
					<br />

					Throughout the process of making a mod, I hope to educate myself on various systems within Minecraft, by creating custom mechanics that play into various features.
					Below is a list of features that I would like to have exposure to by the end of this project.
					<ul>
						<li>Items and Blocks with unique features</li>
						<li>Creative menu tab for mod items</li>
						<li>Mobs with multiple parts</li>
						<li>Container UI</li>
						<li>
							World Generation
							<ul>
								<li>Structures</li>
								<li>Features</li>
								<li>Ores</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Custom Dimension</li>
						<li>Multiplayer (ensure that all features work on both a singleplayer and multiplayer world)</li>
					</ul>

				<td>Pokémon Game Engine</td>
				<td class="align-left">
					Pokémon is one of the most popular RPGs worldwide, and many people have been interested in making their own story or region to travel through.
					This game engine is intended to be a "drag-and-drop" style editor to make custom Pokémon games.
					<br /><b>More information to be added later</b>
					<br />
					<br />

					In this game engine, I would like to have:
					<ul>
						<li>Pokémon Battles</li>
						<li>Trigger Events</li>
						<li>Basic scripting language (or a preexisting language) for triggers and custom effects</li>
						<li>Customizable Pokémon and forms</li>
						<li>Customizable Attacks</li>
						<li>Customizable Items</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<br />

					<b>NOTE:</b> Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have issued cease and desists for other Pokémon fangames (such as Pokémon Uranium).
					While it is unlikely that this project will be taken down during development, as it will not be shared much during the development, it may be in danger if it gains a lot of attention.
